GIT
- Version control system is a tool that track changes in code.
    - popular
    - free and open source
    - fast & scalable

*it tracks the history of our codes.
* helps in collaboration

GITHUB
- Website that allows developers to store and manage their code using git tools.
- We create repository(folders) on github

REPO CREATION
- README- A special type of file where we can write a long discription about
          our project.
        - Every kind of info we can write there.

#INITIAL COMMIT - Our very first recorded change in the repository, marking the
project starting point.
#COMMIT MEANS CHANGES

#If we want to change any further, firstof all we need to add firt then we can commit.
Commit means the change is done, add means the code is ready to be commit.
- its a two step process. (not on github, on github we can change directly withoud add)


# Setting Up GIT
    #Configuring Git
    * git config --global user.name ""
    * git config --global user.email ""
    * git config --list

* cd - change directory
* ls - list of files present in the directory
* ls -a - to see all hidden files
Remote - Files on Github              Local - Files on laptops or pc

#   clone and status
cloning a repository in our local
clone- git clone https link

#Status- displays the status of the code
-Untracked - new files that git doesnt know about.

-Modifiedd- Changed

- Staged (add)- file is ready to be commited

- unmodified - unchanged


# ADD AND COMMIT
git add <-file name->
commit git commit -m 
 changes will be done in our local system, 
 to make changes in repository in github, we will push the code.

#PUSH COMMMAND
upload local content to remote repo

-- git push origin main

The command git push origin main is used to upload commits from your local 
main branch to the main branch on the remote repository named origin

## If we are making folders and writiing code in our local first, and wish to 
push it to github, then we need to create a repo in github and perform following steps

echo "# DSA-TRACKER" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Tanveer6905/DSA-TRACKER.git
git push -u origin main


## GIT BRANCHES
Git branches are lightweight, movable pointers to a snapshot of 
our changes (a commit), which allow us to diverge from the main 
line of development and work on new features or bug fixes in isolation 
without affecting the main codebase. 

## BRANCH COMMANDS
- git branch (to check the current branch)
- git branch -M main (to rename the branch)
- git checkout <branch name> (to navigate between branches)
- git checkout -b <branch name> (to create new branch)
- git branch -d <branch name> (to delete the branch)
